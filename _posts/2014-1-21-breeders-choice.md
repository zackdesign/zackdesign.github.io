title: New Look for Breeder's Choice
---

[Breeder's Choice Packaged Woodshavings](http://breederschoice.com.au) were keen to update the look of their site and came to us for help. Since Zack Design now has extensive experience in digital marketing and building websites for end users, search engines, and lead generation, we decided that the best method of showcasing the Breeder's Choice brand and content was with a single page website.

We used parallax to make the background images a bit more dynamic, Bootstrap to provide the general layout and functionality, Wordpress to allow them to make changes if required, and Font Awesome for all their iconography.

We're happy with the [end result](http://breederschoice.com.au), as is Google.
