title: New Zack Design Update
---

Not content with sitting idly by, Zack Design has been migrated to Github and Jekyll. It is now fully versioned and super fast thanks to this particular mix of technologies. For more information on how to leverage this kind of website design please feel free to contact us using the sidebar or the navigation menu.

More technical information:

* Github hosting and revisions
* Jekyll ruby script and gems used to parse and build the static site files
* Cloudflare provides the Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
* Bootstrap 3
* FontAwesome

To come later:

* Jekyll plugins such as the sitemap plugin
* Individual post pages
* Randomised background images on each site generation
* SASS
* Bootstrap 4
