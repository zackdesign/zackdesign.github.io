title: Hyde - a new Open-Source Jekyll project
---

Hyde, a Jekyll backend for editing content for Github pages, has been started by Zack Design/Isaac Rowntree and is succesfully editing content live for two websites already! Check it out on [Github](https://github.com/isaacrowntree/hyde/).

As part of this we moved [AC Parts](http://acparts.com.au) to Bootstrap and Github Pages and are editing it with Hyde and seeing a jump in conversions!
