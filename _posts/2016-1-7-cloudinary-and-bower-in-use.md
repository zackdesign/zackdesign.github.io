title: Cloudinary &amp; Bower Now in Use
---

Zack Design has updated this website to use Cloudinary to serve re-sized images
on the fly for the background images of this website. The images are set for each
device or screen used to view this site and should degrade gracefully.

Also, bower has been used to version and manage the Cloudinary 3rd-party Javascript and CSS
in use on this site, and will almost certainly be used continuously from this point on.
